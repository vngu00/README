# INTRODUCTION
The Lab 1 Activity is to show how we want our class grade to be determined. In this assignment, we take the different categories that will make up our grade and determine the percentage that it should take. The different categories which will be mentioned are: homework assignments, midterm, project, and final. 

# REQUIREMENTS
There are no requirements for this assignment.

# PSEUDO CODE
float Final_grade = 1.00  
float Homework = 0.45  
float Midterm = 0.2  
float Project = 0.15  
float Final = 0.2  

if [  
    print("Please enter name of student: ")  
    //pass input as string and store in array  
    print("Please enter student ID: ")  
    //pass input as int and store in array  
    print("Would you like to add another student? Y for Yes. N for No")  
    //pass input as string. If y was chosen, loop again. If no, end loop.  
    ]  
    print("How many homework assignments were assigned?")  
    //pass input as int. Use this for length of homework assignments array and to divide.
